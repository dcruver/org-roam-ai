* Database Optimization Techniques

This note discusses various techniques for optimizing database performance.

** Indexing Strategies

Proper indexing is crucial for query performance:
- Create indexes on frequently queried columns
- Use composite indexes for multi-column queries
- Monitor index usage and remove unused indexes

** Query Optimization

- Avoid SELECT *
- Use EXPLAIN to analyze query plans
- Consider denormalization for read-heavy workloads

** Connection Pooling

Always use connection pooling in production to manage database connections efficiently.
