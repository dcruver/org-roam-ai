* Binary Search Trees

A binary search tree (BST) is a node-based binary tree data structure with the following properties:

** Properties

- Left subtree contains nodes with keys less than the parent
- Right subtree contains nodes with keys greater than the parent
- Both subtrees are also binary search trees

** Time Complexity

- Search: O(log n) average, O(n) worst case
- Insert: O(log n) average, O(n) worst case
- Delete: O(log n) average, O(n) worst case

** Applications

BSTs are useful for:
- Implementing symbol tables
- Priority queues
- Database indexing (B-trees are a variant)
