* Spring Boot Best Practices

Spring Boot provides a powerful framework for building production-ready applications.
This note covers key best practices learned from real-world experience.

** Configuration Management

Always externalize configuration using application.yml or application.properties.
Use profiles for different environments (dev, test, prod).

** Dependency Injection

Prefer constructor injection over field injection for better testability:
- Immutable dependencies
- Easier to mock in tests
- Clear dependencies

** Error Handling

Implement global exception handlers using @ControllerAdvice.
Return meaningful error responses with proper HTTP status codes.

** Testing

Write comprehensive tests at multiple levels:
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for components
- End-to-end tests for critical paths
