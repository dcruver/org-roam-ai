;;; Commentary:
;; AI-powered enhancement and analysis for org-roam notes with vector context.
;;
;; This package provides intelligent AI assistance for your org-roam knowledge base.
;; It uses vector similarity search to find related notes and includes that context
;; when making AI suggestions, resulting in more relevant and connected enhancements.
